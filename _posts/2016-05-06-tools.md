\#tools

Facebook is a time destroyer. That's great for Facebook. After all their goal it to have you spend as much time there as possible. For all areas of your life. Messaging. News. Friends. Family. Everything. 

That's not good for anyone. Rather than living my life, I find that I'm viewing others live theirs. And frankly they are probably doing the same. With the exception of the first 5 minutes of any adventure they may take. After the first 5 minutes, the little drug addicted voice in your head says "others should see how much fun I'm having." Then they're sucked back in the Facebook vacuum. 

It's not that I'd intentionally say "I'd like to blow 20 minutes." Instead, I have a spare moment and my fingers unintentionally type "fa..." and the pre-load bar takes care of the rest. 20 minutes later I'm stuck in some far corner of the internet wishing I had something else.

Enter Facebook News Feed Eradicator. A real game changer. Not only can I not see any news feed, I now find myself saying "why did I type 'fa...' and let Facebook load?" 

This tool has led me to a further question. If I haven't see updates in over a month, why do I keep coming here? How long before the habit breaks?

Is my addiction of Facebook so obsessive that I'll forever be that person who stopped smoking but longs for the drag?
