**Dad Fat.** Great name, right?

Inspired by Jim Gaffigan's book "Dad is fat," the book is a must read. More 'real life' than 'funny read' for me, its stories tell my stories as well. I hope to share my stories here as well.

Why this picture?[][0][Unsplash][1] didn't have a picture of "fat." They did however have a picture of "exercise." 

Beautiful. Inspiring. Not what I'll be doing this weekend. 

Instead, I'll be wrestling with my kids, eating leftover mac-n-cheese (white cheddar only), and making fart noises in my superhero persona.

In my family dad fat is welcomed. The stories here will tell of the 'good' and 'bad' fat that comes with being dad. Stay and while. Eat some cheetos and wipe your fingers off with a baby wipe from the stash you have somewhere in the room.
